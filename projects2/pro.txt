Ideas for Celebrating Poem in Your Pocket Day
The beauty of Poem in Your Pocket Day is its simplicity. Individuals
and institutions have generated many creative ways to share poems
on this special dayâ€”from having children create handmade pockets to
tuck their favorite poems into, to handing out poems to commuters at
transportation hubs, to distributing poem scrolls in hospitals, nursing
homes, and local businesses. The ideas are endless but here are a few
to get you started. And, of course, we invite you to share poems on any
day during National Poetry Month or during the year!
