In Your School
•	 If you’re a school principal or administrator, organize a schoolwide Poem in Your Pocket Day giveaway using the following curated collection of poems.
•	 Encourage students to choose a poem from our collection, print
it out, and post it in a designated area, such as the school cafeteria, hallways, or the student lounge.
•	 Hold a student reading of the poems they’ve selected.
In Your Classroom
•	 Have your students choose a poem from our collection. Ask
them to write a letter to a far-away friend or relative detailing
what they like about the poem and why they think the recipient
would enjoy it. Send the letters and poems so they arrive on
Poem in Your Pocket Day.
•	 Ask your students to choose their favorite poem from our collection, choose their favorite lines, and add those lines to a bookmark they can decorate with drawings. Collect the bookmarks
and redistribute them, letting each student pick one that’s not
their own for ongoing use in class.
•	 Ask your students to memorize a poem and share it with the
class.
•	 Have your students choose a poem to give away. Ask them to
print out 20 copies of the poem and come up with a creative
way to distribute it, such as in the form of a folded-paper animal
or object (see the Appendix for instructions on how to create a
folded swan), a decorated scroll, a poem tree, or a bookmark.
•	 Devote a class lesson to teaching your students about the haiku, a three-line poem with seventeen syllables, written in a 5/7/5
syllable count. (See the Appendix for more about the haiku.) Ask
your students write their own haikus and share them with the
class by reading them aloud. Have your students decorate a copy
of their haikus with drawings and stickers, then encourage them
to give their poems to a family member or friend.
•	 Organize a class trip for students to visit a nursing home or
community center and to read and share their favorite poems.
